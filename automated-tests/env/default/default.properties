# Parallel execution by using threads
# In parallel execution, every stream starts a new worker process. This can be optimized by using multithreading instead of processes. Multithreading uses only one worker process and starts multiple threads for parallel execution.
# Currently, only the Java and .NET language runners supports parallel execution of specs by using threads.
