Information about appointing a legal or another representative
It is not necessary to appoint a legal or other representative to act on a victim’s behalf. If a representative is appointed at any stage, please be aware that:

CICA cannot meet their costs
we will only communicate directly with any appointed representative
If we make an award, we will pay it only to the victim or their legal representative. This is unless the application has been made on behalf of:

an adult who cannot manage their own financial affairs
a child who is under 18 years of age
It is our general policy to put an award for a child in an interest-earning deposit account until they reach the age of 18.

If a monetary award is to be made and there is a dispute about outstanding legal fees, it is our policy to retain the disputed amount until the dispute has been resolved.

If it is decided that a representative’s services are no longer required, CICA must be notified in writing as soon as possible.
