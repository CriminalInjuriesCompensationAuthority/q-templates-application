What happens next
We will:

ask the police for evidence
ask for medical information if required
ask you for more information if we need it
make a decision
send our decision letter by post
We aim to make a decision within 12 months but it can take longer. We may have to wait until thereâ€™s enough information about your injuries and recovery.
